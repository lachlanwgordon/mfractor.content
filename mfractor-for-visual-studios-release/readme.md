*MFractor for Visual Studio Windows is now available!*

I'm pleased to announce that MFractor is now available for Visual Studio Windows! ðŸ¥³

Long anticipated, MFractor is a collection of powerful productivity tools for Xamarin developers. Mac users have long enjoyed our tools and we are excited to now offer Windows developers the same productivity benefits!

## Benefits of MFractor for Visual Studio Windows

MFractor really shines in two major areas of Xamarin development; writing beautiful, bug free XAML and managing the image assets in your Android and iOS projects.

### Craft Beautiful XAML
Amongst Xamarin developers, Xamarin.Forms is a very popular way to create compelling mobile applications with maximum code reuse using C# and XAML.

MFractor enhances this experience in many ways, making it much easier for you to write clean, maintainable and bug-free XAML code.

Our powerful XAML analyser immediately spots 80+ XAML issues while you edit, providing a concise description of the issue and often suggesting one or more fixes you can apply in one click:

Our suite of 90+ XAML refactorings make it dead-easy to refactor, fix and organise your XAML.

For example, noticing a common set of properties in a control type? Use the [Extract Style Refactoring](https://docs.mfractor.com/xamarin-forms/working-with-styles/extracting-styles/) to extract a new style and then our code analysis engine will start finding matches:

Lastly, MFractor adds MVVM navigation shortcuts, design-time binding analysis and IntelliSense for your ViewModels, many additional IntelliSense completions and much, much more. [Please see our documention to learn more]().

### Mobile Image Assets Simplified
Image assets are the backbones of mobile apps and, love em or hate em, those many image density files are here to stay.

Nobody likes adding the same image 9 times into a solution (talk about tedious)... [so we created the image importer](https://docs.mfractor.com/image-management/image-importer/)!

Choose a source image, the projects you want to add that image too and voila! MFractor will generate all the density variants of that asset:

MFractor's image toolsuite also includes:

 * [The Image Manager](https://docs.mfractor.com/image-management/managing-image-assets/): A pad that summarises all images in your solution and lets you visually explore them.
 * [The Image Deletion Tool](https://docs.mfractor.com/image-management/deleting-image-assets/): Remove all traces of an image asset from your Android and iOS projects.
 * [The Image Optimiser](https://docs.mfractor.com/image-management/optimising-image-assets/): Significantly reduce the size your image assets with no visual quality loss.
