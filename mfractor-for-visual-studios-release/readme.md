*MFractor for Visual Studio Windows is now available!*

I'm pleased to announce that MFractor is now available for Visual Studio Windows! ðŸ¥³

Long anticipated, MFractor is a collection of powerful productivity tools for Xamarin developers. Mac users have long enjoyed our tools and we are excited to now offer Windows developers the same productivity benefits!

## Benefits of MFractor for Visual Studio Windows

MFractor shines in two major areas of Xamarin development; writing beautiful, bug free XAML and managing your Android and iOS projects image assets.

### Craft Beautiful XAML
Amongst Xamarin developers, Xamarin.Forms is a very popular way to create compelling mobile applications with maximum code reuse using C# and XAML.

MFractor enhances this experience in many ways, making it much easier for you to write clean, maintainable and bug-free XAML code.

Our powerful XAML analyser immediately spots 80+ XAML issues while you edit, providing a concise description of the issue and often suggesting one or more fixes you can apply in one click:

Our suite of 90+ XAML refactorings make it dead-easy to refactor, fix and organise your XAML.

For example, noticing a common set of properties in a control type? Use the [Extract Style Refactoring](https://docs.mfractor.com/xamarin-forms/working-with-styles/extracting-styles/) to extract a new style and then our code analysis engine will start finding matches:

MVVM is one of the most common development patterns in Xamarin.Forms and MFractor streamlines your development workflows when using MVVM. Our intelligent view-model resolver can find the ViewModel for a view by [either naming convention](https://docs.mfractor.com/xamarin-forms/binding-context-resolution/automatic-viewmodel-detection/), [explicit binding context wireup](https://docs.mfractor.com/xamarin-forms/binding-context-resolution/binding-context-evaluation/) or [using our DesignTimeBindingContextAttribute](https://docs.mfractor.com/xamarin-forms/binding-context-resolution/design-time-binding-context-attribute/), enabling multiple

Use the View/ViewModel navigation shortcuts to easily move between your XAML views, code behinds and

Our data-binding analysis spots potential binding bugs and allows you to fix them in a single click:

Our ViewModel data-binding IntelliSense conveniently puts all available ViewModel properties at your fingertips:

### Mobile Image Assets Simplified
Image assets are the backbones of mobile apps and, love em or hate em, those many image density files are here to stay.

Nobody likes adding the same image 9 times into a solution (talk about tedious)... [so we created the image importer](https://docs.mfractor.com/image-management/image-importer/)!

Choose a source image, the projects you want to add that image too and voila! MFractor will generate all the density variants of that asset:

![Using the image importer to easily add a new image asset into a mobile solution](img/image-importer.png)

Use our [image asset manager](https://docs.mfractor.com/image-management/managing-image-assets/) pad to view all images in your solution and lets you visually explore them:

![Using the mobile image asset manager](img/image-asset-manager.png)

Easily delete all densities of an image asset from all iOS and Android projects in your solution using the [the image deletion tool](https://docs.mfractor.com/image-management/deleting-image-assets/):

![The image deletion tool](img/image-deletion-tool.png)

Use image asset tooltips, supported in XAML, C# and for Android projects, to visually see an image asset in code:
