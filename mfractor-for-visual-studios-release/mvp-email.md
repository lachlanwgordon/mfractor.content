Hello fellow Xamarin MVPs! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

For those whom I haven't yet met, I'm the author of MFractor, a productivity extension for Xamarin developers for Visual Studio Mac.

**I'm pleased to announce that MFractor is now available for Visual Studio Windows.**

Over the last few years I've worked to identify and address ways to improve the development experience in Visual Studio Mac. I've built image and font management tooling, C# refactorings, extensive XAML tools including IntelliSense, analysis and code actions plus much more. Approximately 80% of these features are in our stable Windows release ðŸ¥³

I plan to continue doing this and, hopefully, start going faster now that a Windows product is available.

Therefore, a small request: As the organisers of local user groups, it would be extremely helpful if the Windows release be mentioned in your local user group for this month. I've attached our logo image and you can include the text below as a single slide:
