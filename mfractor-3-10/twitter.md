# Part 2: Highlight image tooltips support and what it offers

This release also added a long needed addition to the XAML editor, image tooltips ðŸŽŠ

When MFractor suggests image assets in IntelliSense, it now shows a preview of that image asset ðŸ¥³

You can also hover over any image reference in XAML to see an image preview.


# Part 3: Color tooltips and intellisense suggestions

MFractor 3.10 also adds color tooltips.
